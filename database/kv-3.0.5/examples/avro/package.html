A client application that illustrates the use of Avro bindings.
<p>
The code can be found in KVHOME/examples/avro/.  There are three separate
examples in this directory:
<pre>
 JsonExample.java
 GenericExample.java
 SpecificExample.java
</pre>
Each of these demonstrates the use of a different type of binding:
{@link oracle.kv.avro.JsonAvroBinding}, {@link
oracle.kv.avro.GenericAvroBinding} and {@link
oracle.kv.avro.SpecificAvroBinding}.
<p>
A comparison of the three types of bindings is found in their javadoc and the
javadoc for {@link oracle.kv.avro.AvroCatalog}.  It is also useful to compare
the three examples side by side to see the differences.
<p>
Instructions for building and running each example are at the top of each
example source file.
