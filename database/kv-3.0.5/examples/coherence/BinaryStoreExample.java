/**
 * This is a simple Oracle NoSQL Database client application that demonstrates
 * an integration of an existing Oracle Coherence application with Oracle NoSQL
 * Database.  This example uses the {@link NoSQLBinaryStore} module, which is a
 * pre-built implementation of the Oracle Coherence {@link BinaryEntryStore}
 * interface to manage interaction with with an Oracle NoSQL Database instance.
 * <p>
 * Objects that are manipulated by an Oracle Coherence application need to be
 * serialized when moving them between the application space and the Oracle
 * Coherence cache, as well as between the Oracle Coherence Cache and a
 * {@link BinaryEntryStore} implementation.  Oracle Coherence supports a
 * variety of mechanisms for doing this, including multiple native Java
 * Serialization techniques, multiple Oacle Coherence Portable Object Format
 * (POF) techniques, and the ability to use user-provided serialization
 * implementations.  This example assumes that an application exists with a
 * working Serialization scheme in place.  This example provides
 * POF serialization for the {@link Person} implementation.
 * Although we encourage users to migrate to an Avro schema for object storage
 * format, the BinaryEntryStore implementation will leverage the existing
 * application object serialization to allow for the integration to be
 * implemented with minimal impact to the Oracle Coherence application code.
 * <p>
 * Because this example is using the {@link NoSQLBinaryStore} module to
 * interact with the Oracle NoSQL Database, instance it does not need to
 * directly use Oracle NoSQL Database classes in order allow the Oracle NoSQL
 * Database to provide persistent backing for an Oracle Coherence cache.  The
 * {@link NoSQLBinaryStore} module relies on application-controlled
 * serialization.
 * <p>
 * The cache-config.xml file in this directory includes a definition for the
 * {@code BinaryCache} cache.  It is assumed that the reader has some level of
 * familiarity with Oracle Coherence cache configuration.  The
 * {@code BinaryCache} has a {@code cache-mapping} that references a
 * {@code distributed-scheme} named {@code BinaryCacheScheme}.  Note that
 * although Oracle Coherence allows for a variety of different cache schemes,
 * {@link BinaryEntryStore} is specifically designed to work within distributed
 * cache schemes.
 * <p>
 * Please note that this example is structured, for simplicity, to assume that
 * the example program is the only member of the cache cluster.  In a real
 * environment it will be necessary to have all cache cluster members using the
 * same cache configuration file.
 * <p>
 * The distributed scheme contains a serializer definition that tells Oracle
 * Coherence to use the Oracle Coherence Portable Object Format when
 * serializing and de-serializing objects in association with this cache.  Its
 * configuration relies on a POF configuration file to control the type mapping
 * for the application.
 * <p>
 * The {@code distributed-scheme} also contains the definition of a
 * {@code cachestore-scheme} within a {@code read-write-backing-map-scheme}.
 * Here, the definition specifies {@code storeName} and {@code helperHosts}
 * parameters to allow access to the Oracle NoSQL Database instance, in
 * association with this cache.  Its configuration includes init-param
 * definitions for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code storeName} - identifies the Oracle NoSQL Database instance name
 *     that will be backing the cache.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code helperHosts} - contains a comma-separated list of host:port
 *     identifiers for hosts to contact in order to set up a connection to the
 *     Oracle NoSQL Database instance.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the kvclient.jar file, this application also requires that
 * kvcoherence.jar and coherence.jar be included in the classpath.
 * kvcoherence.jar is included in the same directory as kvclient.jar for Oracle
 * NoSQL Database EE distributions.  The kvcoherence.jar file internally
 * references kvclient.jar so it does not need to be explicitly referenced in
 * the classpath.  The coherence.jar file should be downloaded and installed
 * separately.
 * <p>
 * To build this example in the examples/coherence directory:
 * <pre>
 *   cd KVHOME/examples/coherence
 *   javac -cp KVHOME/lib/kvcoherence.jar:COHERENCE_HOME/lib/coherence.jar \
 *         -d classes *.java
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Before running this example program, start an Oracle NoSQL Database instance.
 * The simplest way to do that is to run kvlite as described in the Quickstart
 * document.
 * <p>
 * Before running the example, modify the coherence-cache.xml file, if
 * necessary, and update the definitions of the storeName and helperHosts
 * parameters with the appropriate values based on your kvstore instance.  For
 * all examples the default instance name is kvstore, the default host name is
 * localhost and the default port number is 5000.
 * Then, run this program, as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * java -cp classes:KVHOME/lib/kvcoherence.jar:COHERENCE_HOME/lib/coherence.jar \
 *         -Dtangosol.pof.config=pof-config.xml \
 *         -Dtangosol.coherence.cacheconfig=cache-config.xml \
 *         coherence.BinaryStoreExample -cache BinaryCache
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In this example a single key is used for storing a kv pair, where the value
 * is an object serialized using Portable Object Format encoding.  The first
 * time the example is run it inserts the kv pair, and for subsequent
 * executions,  it reads and updates the kv pair, incrementing the "age" field.
