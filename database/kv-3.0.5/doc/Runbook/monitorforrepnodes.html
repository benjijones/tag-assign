            The following metrics can be monitored to get a sense for the
            performance of each replication node in the cluster. There are
            two flavors of metric granularity:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                   Interval – By default, each node in the cluster will
                   sample performance data every 60 seconds and aggregate
                   the metrics to this interval. This interval may be
                   changed using the admin plan change-parameters and
                   supplying the statsInterval parameter with a new value
                   in seconds (see
                   <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/NOSQL/html/AdminGuide/setstoreparams.html#changeparamcli" target="_top">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/NOSQL/html/AdminGuide/setstoreparams.html#changeparamcli</a>).

                   Cumulative – Metrics that have been collected and
                   aggregated since the node has started.

          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
            The metrics are further broken down into measurements for
            operations over single keys versus operations over multiple
            keys.

        <p>
                All timestamp metrics are in UTC, therefore appropriate conversion
                to a time zone relevant to where the store is deployed is
                necessary.

                   then any operation at the repnode that exhibits a
                   latency of 1000 or greater milliseconds is not put
                   into the array of metric samples for subsequent

                   at this replication node before an alert is generated. 
                   For example, if this is set to 3, then any latency
                   sample above 3 generates an alert.

            <p>
                   repNodeThroughputFloor – The lower bound (in operations
                   per second) at which throughput samples may be gathered
                   at this replication node before an alert is generated. 
                   For example, if this is set to 300,000, then any
                   throughput calculation at this replication node that is
                   lower than 300,000 operations per seconds generates an
                   alert.
