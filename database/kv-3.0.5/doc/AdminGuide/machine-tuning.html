       The default tuning parameters available for the Oracle NoSQL Database software
       should in general be acceptable for production systems, and so do not
       require any tuning. However, the underlying operating system will
       have default values for various kernel parameters which require
       modification in order to achieve the best possible performance for
       your store's installation.
   </p>
      <p>
       This appendix identifies the kernel parameters that you should
       manage when installing a <span class="emphasis"><em>production</em></span> store. By
       this, we mean any store whose performance is considered
       critical. Evaluation systems installed into a lab environment
       probably do not need this level of tuning unless you are using those
       systems to measure the store's performance.

        <p>
           Oracle NoSQL Database is most frequently installed on Linux systems, and so
           that is what this appendix focuses on.

           Tune your page cache to permit the OS to write asynchronously to
           disk whenever possible. This allows background writes, which
           minimize the latency resulting from serial write operations such
           as fsync. This also helps with write stalls which occur when the
           file system cache is full and needs to be flushed to disk to
           make room for new writes. We have observed significant speedups
           (15-20%) on insert-intensive benchmarks when these parameters
           are tuned as described below.
       </p>
        <p>
           Place the following commands in <code class="filename">/etc/sysctl.conf</code>. 
           Run 
       </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">sysctl -p</pre>
        <p>
           to load the new settings so they can take effect without
           needing to reboot the machine.
       </p>
        <pre class="programlisting"># Set vm.dirty_background_bytes to 10MB to ensure that
# on a 40MB/sec hard disk a fsync never takes more than 250ms and takes
# just 125ms on average. The value of vm.dirty_background_bytes 
# should be increased on faster SSDs or I/O subsytems with higher
# throughput. You should increase this setting by the same proportion 
# as the relative increase in throughput. For example, for a typical SSD 
# with a throughput of 160MB/sec, vm.dirty_background_bytes should be set 
# to 40MB so fsync takes ~250ms. In this case, the value was increased by
# a factor of 4.
vm.dirty_background_bytes=10485760

# IO calls effectively become synchronous(waiting for the underlying
# device to complete them). This setting helps minimize the
# possibility of a write request stalling in JE while holding the
# write log latch. 
vm.dirty_ratio=40 

# Ensures that data does not hang around in memory longer than
# necessary. Given JE's append-only style of writing, there is
# typically little benefit from having an intermediate dirty page
# hanging around, because it is never going to be modified. By
# evicting the dirty page earlier, its associated memory is readily
# available for reading or writing new pages, should that become
# necessary.
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=1000 </pre>
        <p>
            Earlier versions of the Linux kernel may not support
            <code class="literal">vm.dirty_background_bytes</code>.
            On these older kernels you can
            use <code class="literal">vm.dirty_background_ratio</code>
            instead. Pick the ratio that gets you closest to 10MB.
            On some systems with a lot of memory this may not be
            possible due to the large granularity associated with
            this configuration knob. A further impediment is that a
            ratio of 5 is the effective minimum in some kernels.
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">vm.dirty_background_ratio=5</pre>
        <p>
            Use <code class="literal">sysctl -a</code> to verify that the
            parameters described here are set as expected.
