            There are two ways to recover your store from a previously
            created snapshot. The first mechanism allows you to use a
            backup to create a store with any desired topology. The second
            method requires you to restore the store using the 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>exact same</em></span> topology as was in use when the
            snapshot was taken.
        </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
                If you had to replace a failed Storage Node, that qualifies
                as a topology change. In that case, you must use the
                <code class="literal">Load</code> program to restore your store.
            </p>
        <p>

        <p>
                You can use the <code class="classname">oracle.kv.util.Load</code>
                program to restore a store from a previously created
                snapshot. You can run this program directly, or you can
                access it using <code class="literal">kvstore.jar</code>, as
                shown in the examples in this section.
            </p>
        <p>
                By using this tool, you can restore the store to
                any topology, not just the one that was in use when the
                snapshot was created. 
            </p>
        <p>
                This mechanism works by iterating through all records in a
                snapshot, putting each record into the target store as it
                proceeds through the snapshot. It should be used only to
                restore to a new, empty store. Do not use this with an
                existing store because it only writes records if they
                do not already exist.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that to recover the store, you must load records from
                snapshot data captured for each shard in the store.
                For best results, you should load records using snapshot
                data captured from the replication nodes that were running as
                Master at the time the snapshot was taken. (If you have
                three shards in your store, then there are
                three Masters at any given time, and so you need to
                load data from three sets of snapshot data.)
            </p>
        <p>
                You should use snapshot data taken at the same point in time;
                do not, for example, use snapshot data for shard 1 that was
                taken on Monday, and snapshot data for shard 2
                that was taken on Wednesday because this can cause your
                store to be restored in an inconsistent state.
            </p>
        <p>
                This mechanism can only go at the speed of insertion of the
                new store. Because you probably have multiple shards in
                your store, you should be restoring your store from data
                taken from each shard.  To do this, run the
                <code class="literal">Load</code> program in parallel, with each
                instance operating on data captured from different
                replication nodes.
            </p>
        <p>
                The program's usage is:

              <p>
                        <code class="literal">-source &lt;backupDir&gt;</code>
                        identifies the on-disk location where the snapshot
                        data is stored.
                    </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">-host &lt;hostname&gt;</code>
                        identifies the host name of a node in your store.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">-port &lt;port&gt;</code> identifies
                        the registry port in use by the store's node.
                    </p>
            </li>

              <p>
                        <code class="literal">-status &lt;pathToFile&gt;</code> is an
                        optional parameter that causes the status of the
                        load operation to be saved in the named location on
                        the local machine.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                For example, suppose there is a snapshot in
                <code class="literal">/var/backups/snapshots/110915-153828-later</code>,
                and there is a new store named "NewStore" on host "NewHost"
                using registry port 12345. Run the <code class="literal">Load</code>
                program on the host that has the
                <code class="literal">/var/backups/snapshots</code> directory:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">java -Xmx256m -Xms256m \
-jar KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar load \

          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                     If the load fails part way through the restore, it can
                     start where it left off by using the status file. The
                     granularity of the status file is per-partition in
                     this NoSQL DB release.  If a status file is not used and there
                     is a failure, the load needs to start over from the
                     beginning. The target store does not need to be
                     re-created if this happens, existing records are skipped.

        <p>
                You can restore a store directly from a snapshot. 
                This mechanism is faster than using the <code class="literal">Load</code>
                program described in the previous section, but it can be
                used only to restore to the <span class="emphasis"><em>exact same</em></span>
                topology as was used when the snapshot was taken. This
                means that all ports and host names or IP addresses (depending on
                your configuration) must be exactly the same as when the snapshot was taken.
            </p>
        <p>
                You must perform this procedure for each Storage Node in
                your store, and for each service running on each Storage
                Node.
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Put the to-be-recovered snapshot data in the recovery
                        directory for the service corresponding to the
                        snapshot data. For example, if
                        you are recovering Storage Node sn1, service
                        rg1-rn1 in store <code class="literal">mystore</code> , then
                        log in to the node where that service is running and:
                    </p>
              <pre class="programlisting">&gt; mkdir KVROOT/mystore/sn1/rg1-sn1/recovery
&gt; mv /var/kvroot/mystore/sn1/rg1-rn1/snapshots/110915-153828-later \
KVROOT/mystore/sn1/rg1-sn1/recovery/110915-153828-later </pre>
              <p>
                        Do this for each service running on the Storage
                        Node. Production systems should have only one
                        resource running on a given Storage Node, but it is
                        possible to deploy, for example, multiple
                        replication nodes on a single Storage Node.
                        A Storage Node can also have an administration
                        process running on it, and this also needs to be
                        restored.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Having done this, restart the Storage Node
                    </p>
              <pre class="programlisting">java -Xmx256m -Xms256m \
-jar KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar stop -root /var/kvroot \

          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
                On startup, the Storage Node notices the recovery
                directory, and moves that directory to the resource's
                environment directory and use it.
            </p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

                    Remember that this procedure recovers the store to the time
                    of the snapshot. If your store was active since the time of
                    the snapshot, then all data modifications made since the
                    time of the last snapshot are lost.
