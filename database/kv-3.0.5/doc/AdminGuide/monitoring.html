          Information about the performance and availability of your store
          can be obtained both from a server side and client side
          perspective:
      </p>

                  Your Oracle NoSQL Database applications can obtain performance
                  statistics using the 
                  <code class="classname">oracle.kv.KVStore.getStats()</code>
                  class. This provides a client side view of
                   the complete round trip performance for Oracle NoSQL Database operations.

          <li>
            <p>
                  Oracle NoSQL Database automatically captures Replication Node performance 
                  statistics into a log file that can easily be imported and 
                  analyzed with spreadsheet software. Statistics are tracked,
                  logged and written at a user specified interval to a CSV file (
                  <code class="literal">je.stat.csv</code>)
                  in the Environment directory. The logging occurs per-Environment
                  when the Environment is opened in read/write mode.
              </p>
            <p>
                  Configuration parameters control the size and number of rotating 
                  log files used (similar to java logging, see  
                  <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/FileHandler.html" target="_top"> 
                  java.util.logging.FileHandler).</a>
                  For a rotating set of files, as each file reaches a given size limit, it 
                  is closed, rotated out, and a new file is opened. Successively older files
                  are named by adding "0", "1", "2", etc. into the file name. The format is
                  <code class="literal">je.stat[version number].csv</code>

                  The Oracle NoSQL Database administrative service collects and aggregates
                  status information, alerts, and performance statistics
                  components that are generated in the store. This provides
                  a detailed, server side view of behavior and
                  performance of the Oracle NoSQL Database server.
              </p>

          <li>
            <p>
                  Each Oracle NoSQL Database Storage Node maintains detailed logs of trace
                  information from the services that are housed on that
                  node. The administrative service presents an aggregated,
                  store-wide view of these component logs, but the logs are
                  nevertheless available on each Storage Node in the event
                  that the administrative service is somehow not available,
                  or if it is more convenient to examine the individual
                  logs.

          <li>
            <p>
                  Oracle NoSQL Database allows Java Management Extensions (JMX) or Simple
                  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agents to be optionally
                  available for monitoring. The SNMP and JMX interfaces allow
                  you to poll the Storage Nodes for information about the storage
                  node and about any replication nodes that are hosted on 
                  the Storage Node. See 
                  <a class="xref" href="standardized-monitoring.html" title="Chapter 8.  Standardized Monitoring Interfaces">
      Standardized Monitoring Interfaces
   </a> 
                  for more information.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          In addition to the logging mechanisms noted above, you can also
          view the current health of the store using the Admin Console. This
          information is viewable on the Topology pane. It shows you
          what services are currently unavailable. Problematic services are
          highlighted in red. Two lines at the top of the pane summarize
          the number of available and unavailable services.
      </p>
      <p>
          Finally, you can monitor the status of the store by verifying it
          from within the CLI. See 
          <a class="xref" href="verifyingthestore.html" title="Verifying the Store">Verifying the Store</a>
          for more information. You can also use the CLI to examine events.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>

        <p>
              Events are special messages that inform you of the
              state of your system. As events are generated, they are
              routed through the monitoring system so that you can see
              them. There are four types of events that the store reports:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                      State Change events are issued when a service starts
                      up or shuts down.
                  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                      Performance events report statistics about the
                      performance of various services.
                  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                      Log events are records produced by the various
                      system components to provide trace information about
                      debugging. These records are produced by the standard
                      <code class="classname">java.util.logging</code> package.
                  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                      Plan Change events record the progress of plans as
                      they execute, are interrupted, fail or are canceled.
                  </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
                Note that some events are considered critical. These events are
                recorded in the administration service's database, and can be
                retrieved and viewed using the CLI or the Admin Console.
            </p>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="otherevents"></a>Other Events</h4>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
                    Plan Change events cannot be directly viewed through
                    Oracle NoSQL Database's administrative interfaces.
                    However, State Change events, Performance events,
                    and Log events are recorded using the
                    EventRecorder facility internal to the Admin.  Only events
                    that are considered "critical" are recorded, and the
                    criteria for being designated as such vary with the type of
                    the event.  All state change events are considered
                    critical, but only SEVERE log events are.  Performance
                    events are considered critical if the reported performance
                    is below a certain threshold.
                </p>
          <p>
                    All such events can be viewed in the CLI using the 
                    <code class="literal">show events</code> and 
                    <code class="literal">show event</code> commands.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Use the CLI <code class="literal">show events</code> command with
                    no arguments to see all the unexpired events in the
                    database. You can bound the range of events that are
                    displayed using the <code class="literal">-from</code> and
                    <code class="literal">-to</code> arguments. You can filter
                    events by type or id as well, using either the
                    <code class="literal">-type</code> or 
                    the <code class="literal">-id</code> arguments respectively.
