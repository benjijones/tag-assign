      <p>
              Whenever a node performs a write operation, the node must
              know whether it should wait for the data to be written to
              stable storage before successfully returning from the
              operation.
          </p>
      <p>
              As a part of performing a write operation, the data
              modification is first made to an in-memory cache. It is then
              written to the filesystem's data buffers. And, finally, the
              contents of the data buffers are synchronized to stable
              storage (typically, a hard drive).
          </p>
      <p>
              You can control how much of this process the master node will
              wait to complete before it returns from the write operation
              with a normal status. There are three different levels of
              synchronization durability that you can require:
          </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                      NO_SYNC
                  </p>
            <p>
                      The data is written to the host's in-memory cache,
                      but the master node does not wait for the data
                      to be written to the file system's data buffers, or for the
                      data to be physically transferred to stable storage.
                      This is the fastest, but least durable, synchronization policy.
                  </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                      WRITE_NO_SYNC 
                  </p>
            <p>
                      The data is written to the in-memory cache, and then
                      written to the file system's data buffers, but the
                      data is not necessarily transferred to stable storage
                      before the operation completes normally.
                  </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                      SYNC
                  </p>
            <p>
                      The data is written to the in-memory cache, then
                      transferred to the file system's data buffers, and
                      then synchronized to stable storage before the write
                      operation completes normally. This is the slowest,
                      but most durable, synchronization policy.
                  </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
              Notice that in all cases, the data is eventually written to
              stable storage (assuming some failure does not occur to
              prevent it). The only question is, how much of this process
              will be completed before the write operation returns and your
              application can proceed to its next operation.
