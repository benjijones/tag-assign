          Records in the store are organized as key-value pairs. The
          <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> is the data that you want to store,
          manage and retrieve. In almost all cases, you should create your
          values using Avro to describe the value's data schema. Avro
          schemas are described in 
          <a class="xref" href="avroschemas.html" title="Chapter 7. Avro Schemas">Avro Schemas</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          In simple cases, values can also be organized as a byte array. If
          so, the mapping of the arrays to data structures (serialization
          and deserialization) is left entirely to the application.
          Note that while the earliest portions of this manual show byte
          array usage in its examples, this is not the recommended
          approach. Instead, you should use Avro even for very simple
          values.
      </p>
      <p>
          There are no restrictions on the size of your values. However,
          you should consider your store's performance when deciding how
          large you are willing to allow your individual records to become.
          As is the case with any data storage scheme, the larger your
          record, the longer it takes to read the information from storage,
          and to write the information to storage.  If your values become
          so large that they impact store read/write performance, or are
          even too large to fit into your memory cache (or even your Java
          heap space) then you should consider storing your values using
          Oracle NoSQL Database's large object support. See
          <a class="xref" href="lob.html" title="Chapter 14. Using Large Objects">Using Large Objects</a>
          for details.
      </p>
      <p>
          On the other hand, every record carries with it some amount of
          overhead. Also, as the number of your records grows very large,
          search times may begin to be adversely affected. As a result,
          choosing to store an extremely large number of very small records
          can also harm your store's performance.
      </p>
      <p>
          Therefore, when designing your store's content, you must find the
          appropriate balance between a small number of very large records
          and a large number of very small records. You should also
          consider how frequently any given piece of information will be
          accessed. 
      </p>
      <p>
          For example, suppose your store contains information about users,
          where each user is identified by their email address. There is a
          set of information that you want to maintain about each user.
          Some of this information is small in size, and some of it is
          large. Some of it you expect will be frequently accessed, while
          other information is infrequently accessed.
      </p>
      <p>
          Small properties are:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                  name
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  gender
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  address
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  phone number
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          Large properties are:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    image file
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  public key 1
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  public key 2
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  recorded voice greeting
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          There are several possible ways you can organize this data. How
          you should do it depends on your data access patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
          For example, suppose your application requires you to read and
          write all of the properties identified above every time you
          access a record. (This is unlikely, but it does represent the
          simplest case.) In that event, you might create a single Avro
          schema that represents each of the properties you maintain for
          the users in your application.  You can then trivially organize
          your records using only major key components so that, for
          example, all of the data for user Bob Smith can be accessed using
          the key
          <code class="literal">/Smith/Bob</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, the chances are good that your application will not
          require you to access <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the properties
          for a user's record every time you access that record. While it is
          possible that you will always need to read all of the properties every
          time you perform a user look up, it is likely that on updates you
          will operate only on some properties.
      </p>
      <p>
          Given this, it is useful to consider how frequently data will be
          accessed, and its size. Large, infrequently accessed properties
          should use a key other than that used by the frequently accessed
          properties. The different keys for these large properties can
          share major key components, while differing in their minor key
          components.  However, if you are using large object support for
          your large properties, then these must be under a major key that
          is different from the major key you use for the other properties
          you are storing.
      </p>
      <p>
          At the same time, there is overhead involved with every key your
          store contains, so you do not want to create a key for every
          possible user property. For this reason, if you have a lot of
          small properties, you might want to organize them all under a
          single key even if only some of them are likely to be updated or
          read for any given operation.
      </p>
      <p>
         For example, for the properties identified above, suppose the
         application requires: 
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                  all of the small properties to always be used whenever
                  the user's record is accessed.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  all of the large properties to be read for simple user
                  look ups.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  on user record updates, the public keys are always
                  updated (written) at the same time.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  The image file and recorded voice greeting can be updated
                  independently of everything else.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          In this case, you might store user properties using four keys
          per user. Each key shares the same major components, and differs
          in its minor component, in the following way: 
      </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>/surname</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>familiar
                      name</em></span>/-/contact
              </p>
            <p>
                  The value for this key is a Avro record that contains
                  all of the small user properties (name, phone number,
                  address, and so forth).
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>/surname</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>familiar
                      name</em></span>/-/publickeys
              </p>
            <p>
                  The value for this key is an Avro record that contains
                  the user's public keys. These are always read and written
                  at the same time, so it makes sense to organize them
                  under one key.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  /image.lob/-/<span class="emphasis"><em>surname/familiar
                      name</em></span>
              </p>
            <p>
                  The value for this key is an image file, saved using
                  Oracle NoSQL Database's large object support.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  /audio.lob/-/voicegreeting/<span class="emphasis"><em>surname/familiar
                      name</em></span>
              </p>
            <p>
                  The value for this key is an mp3 file, also saved using
                  the large object support.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
          Any data organized under different keys which differ only in the
          minor key component allows you to read and update the various
          properties all at once using a single atomic operation, which
          gives you full ACID support for user record updates.  At the same
          time, your application does not have to be reading and writing
          large properties (image files, voice recordings, and so forth)
          unless it is absolutely necessary. When it is necessary to read
          or write these large objects, you can use the Oracle NoSQL Database stream
          interface which is optimized for that kind of traffic.
