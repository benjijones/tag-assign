      <p> 
        You can execute a sequence of write operations as a single
        atomic unit so long as all the 
        <span>records</span> 
        
        that you are operating upon
        share the same 
        <span>major path components.</span>
        
        By <span class="emphasis"><em>atomic unit</em></span>, we mean all of the
        operations will execute successfully, or none of them will. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Also, the sequence is performed in isolation. This
        means that if you have a thread running a particularly long
        sequence, then another thread cannot intrude on the data in use by
        the sequence. The second thread will not be able to see any of the
        modifications made by the long-running sequence until the sequence
        is complete. The second thread also will not be able to modify any
        of the data in use by the long-running sequence.
    </p>
      <p>
        Be aware that sequences only support write operations. You can
        perform puts and deletes, but you cannot retrieve data
        when using sequences.
    </p>
      <p>
        When using a sequence of operations:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                All of the keys in use by the sequence must share the same
                <span>major path components.</span>
                
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Operations are placed into a list, but the operations are
                not necessarily executed in the order that they appear in
                the list. Instead, they are executed in an internally
                defined sequence that prevents deadlocks. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                You cannot create two or more operations that operate on
                the same key. Doing so results in an exception, and the
                entire operation is aborted.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        The rest of this chapter shows how to use
        <code class="classname">OperationFactory</code>
        and <code class="methodname">KVStore.execute()</code>
        to create and run a sequence of operations.
    </p>
      <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sequence-errors"></a>Sequence Errors</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            If any operation within the sequence experiences an error, then
            the entire operation is aborted. In this case, your data is
            left in the same state it would have been in if the sequence
            had never been run at all — no matter how much of the
            sequence was run before the error occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fundamentally, there are two reasons why a sequence might
            abort:
        </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                    An internal operation results in an exception that is
                    considered a fault. For example, the operation throws a
                    <code class="classname">DurabilityException</code>. Also, if
                    there is an internal failure due to message delivery or
                    a networking error.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    An individual operation returns normally but is
                    unsuccessful as defined by the particular operation.
                    (For example, you attempt to delete a 
                    <span>key</span> 
                     
                    that does not exist). If this occurs AND you specified
                    <code class="literal">true</code> for the
                    <code class="literal">abortIfUnsuccessful</code> parameter when
                    the operation was created using 
                    <span>OperationFactory,</span>
                    
                    then an
                    <code class="classname">OperationExecutionException</code> is
                    thrown. This exception contains information about the
                    failed operation.
