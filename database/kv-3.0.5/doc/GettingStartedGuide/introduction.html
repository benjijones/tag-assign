        Welcome to Oracle NoSQL Database. Oracle NoSQL Database provides multi-terabyte
        distributed key/value pair storage that offers scalable throughput
        and performance.  That is, it services network requests to store
        and retrieve data which is accessed as tables of information or,
        optionally, as key-value pairs.  Oracle NoSQL Database services these types of
        data requests with a latency, throughput, and data consistency that
        is predictable based on how the store is configured.
    </p>
      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database offers full Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)
        operations with adjustable durability guarantees.  Oracle NoSQL Database is
        designed to be highly available, with excellent throughput and
        latency, while requiring minimal administrative interaction. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database provides performance scalability. If you require better
        performance, you use more hardware. If your performance
        requirements are not very steep, you can purchase and manage fewer
        hardware resources. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database is meant for any application that requires
        network-accessible data with user-definable read/write
        performance levels.  The typical application is a web application
        which is servicing requests across the traditional three-tier
        architecture: web server, application server, and back-end
        database. In this configuration, Oracle NoSQL Database is meant to be installed
        behind the application server, causing it to either take the place
        of the back-end database, or work alongside it. To make use of
        Oracle NoSQL Database, code must be written (using Java or C) that runs on the
        application server.
    </p>
      <p>
        An application makes use of Oracle NoSQL Database by performing network requests
        against Oracle NoSQL Database's data store, which is referred to as the
        KVStore.  The requests are made using the Oracle NoSQL Database Driver, which is
        linked into your application as a Java library (.jar file), and
        then accessed using a series of Java APIs. 
    </p>
      <p>
        By using the Oracle NoSQL Database APIs, the developer is able to perform create,
        read, update and delete operations on the data contained in the
        KVStore. The usage of these APIs is introduced later in this
        manual.
    </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
            Oracle NoSQL Database is tested using Java 7, and so Oracle NoSQL Database should be used
            only with that version of Java.

        <p>
            The KVStore is a collection of Storage Nodes which host a set
            of Replication Nodes.  Data is spread across the Replication
            Nodes. Given a traditional three-tier web architecture, the
            KVStore either takes the place of your back-end database, or
            runs alongside it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The store contains multiple Storage Nodes.  A 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Storage Node</em></span> is a physical (or virtual)
            machine with its own local storage.  The machine is intended to
            be commodity hardware. It should be, but is not required to be,
            identical to all other Storage Nodes within the store.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following illustration depicts the typical architecture
            used by an application that makes use of Oracle NoSQL Database:
        </p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
          <img src="KVStoreArchitecture.jpg" alt="NoSQL Database Store Architecture" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Every Storage Node hosts one or more Replication Nodes as determined
            by its <span class="emphasis"><em>capacity</em></span>. The capacity of a Storage Node
            serves as a rough measure of the hardware resources associated with
            it. A store can consist of Storage Nodes of different
            capacities. Oracle NoSQL Database will ensure that a Storage Node is assigned a load
            that is proportional to its capacity. 

            
            A Replication Node in turn contains at least one and typically many
            partitions.
            
            Also, each Storage Node contains monitoring software that
            ensures the Replication Nodes which it hosts are running and
            are otherwise healthy.

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
                At a very high level, a 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication Node</em></span> can be thought of as 
                a single database which contains key-value pairs. 
            </p>
          <p>
                Replication Nodes are organized into
                <span class="emphasis"><em>shards</em></span>. A shard contains a single
                Replication Node, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span>
                node, which is responsible for performing database writes,
                as well as one or more read-only
                <span class="emphasis"><em>replicas</em></span>.  The
                <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> node copies all writes to the
                replicas.  These replicas are used to service read-only
                operations.  Although there can be only one master node at
                any given time, any of the members of the shard (with the
                exception of nodes in a secondary zone as described below)
                are capable of becoming a <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> node.
                In other words, each shard uses a single master/multiple
                replica strategy to improve read throughput and
                availability.
            </p>
          <p>
                The following illustration shows how the KVStore is
                divided up into shards:
            </p>
          <div class="mediaobject">
            <img src="RepGroups.jpg" alt="NoSQL Database shards" />
          </div>
          <p>
                Note that if the machine hosting the master should fail in
                any way, then the master automatically fails over to one of
                the other nodes in the shard. That is, one of the replica
                nodes is automatically promoted to master.
            </p>
          <p>
                Production KVStores should contain multiple shards. At
                installation time you provide information that allows
                Oracle NoSQL Database to automatically decide how many shards the store
                should contain. The more shards that your store contains,
                the better your write performance is because the store
                contains more nodes that are responsible for servicing
                write requests.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">

              <div>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
                The number of nodes belonging to a shard is called its
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication Factor</em></span>. The larger a
                shard's Replication Factor, the faster its read throughput
                (because there are more machines to service the read
                requests) but the slower its write performance (because
                there are more machines to which writes must be copied).
                Once you set the Replication Factor for each zone in the
                store, Oracle NoSQL Database makes sure the appropriate number of
                Replication Nodes are created for each shard residing in
                each zone making up your store.
            </p>

          <p>
                Each shard contains one or more
                <span class="emphasis"><em>partitions</em></span>.  Table rows (or key-value
                pairs) in the store are accessed by the data's key. Keys,
                in turn, are assigned to a partition. Once a key is placed
                in a partition, it cannot be moved to a different
                partition.  Oracle NoSQL Database spreads records evenly across all
                available partitions by hashing each record's key.
            </p>
          <p>
                As part of your planning activities, you must decide how
                many partitions your store should have. Note that this is
                not configurable after the store has been installed.
            </p>
          <p>
                It is possible to expand and change the number of Storage
                Nodes in use by the store. When this happens, the store can
                be reconfigured to take advantage of the new resources by
                adding new shards. When this happens, partitions are
                balanced between new and old shards by redistributing
                partitions from one shard to another. For this reason, it
                is desirable to have enough partitions so as to allow
                fine-grained reconfiguration of the store. Note that there
                is a minimal performance cost for having a large number of
                partitions. As a rough rule of thumb, there should be at
                least 10 to 20 partitions per shard, and the number of
                partitions should be evenly divisible by the number of
                shards. Since the number of partitions cannot be changed
                after the initial deployment, you should consider the
                maximum future size of the store when specifying the number
                of partitions.

                A zone is a physical location that supports good network
                connectivity among the Storage Nodes deployed in it and has
                some level of physical separation from other zones.  A zone
                generally includes redundant or backup power supplies,
                redundant data communications connections, environmental
                controls (for example: air conditioning, fire suppression) and
                security devices. A zone may represent an actual physical data
                center building, but could also represent a floor, room, pod,
                or rack, depending on the particular deployment.  Oracle
                recommends you install and configure your store across
                multiple zones to guard against systemic failures affecting an
                entire physical location, such as a large scale power or
                network outage.
            </p>
          <p>
                Multiple zones provide fault isolation and increase the
                availability of your data in the event of a single zone
                failure.
            </p>
          <p>
                Zones come in two types.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Primary</em></span> zones
                contain nodes which can serve as masters or replicas.  Zones
                are created as primary zones by default.
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Secondary</em></span> zones contain nodes which can
                only serve as replicas.  Secondary zones can be used to make a

                A <span class="emphasis"><em>topology</em></span> is the collection of
                zones, storage nodes, replication nodes and administration
                services that make up a NoSQL DB store. A deployed store
                has one topology that describes its state at a given time. 
            </p>
          <p>
                After initial deployment, the topology is laid out so as to minimize
                the possibility of a single point of failure for any given shard.
                This means that while a Storage Node might host more than one Replication 
                Node, those Replication Nodes will never be from the same shard. This
                improves the chances of the shard continuing to be available for reads 
                and writes even in the face of a hardware failure that takes down the
                host machine.
                
            </p>
          <p>
                Topologies can be changed to achieve different performance
                characteristics, or in reaction to changes in the number or
                characteristics of the Storage Nodes. Changing and
                deploying a topology is an iterative process.
