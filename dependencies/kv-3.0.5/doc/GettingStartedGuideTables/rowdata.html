          There are no restrictions on the size of your rows, or the amount
          of data that you store in a field. However,
          you should consider your store's performance when deciding how
          large you are willing to allow your individual tables and rows to become.
          As is the case with any data storage scheme, the larger your
          rows, the longer it takes to read the information from storage,
          and to write the information to storage.  
      </p>
      <p>
          On the other hand, every table row carries with it some amount of
          overhead. Also, as the number of your rows grows very large,
          search times may be adversely affected. As a result, choosing to
          use a large number of tables, each of which use rows with just a
          small handful of fields, can also harm your store's performance.
      </p>
      <p>
          Therefore, when designing your tables' content, you must find the
          appropriate balance between a small number of tables, each of
          which uses very large rows; and a large number of tables, each of
          which uses very small rows. You should also consider how
          frequently any given piece of information will be accessed. 
      </p>
      <p>
          For example, suppose your table contains information about users,
          where each user is identified by their first and last names
          (surname and familiar name). There is a set of information that
          you want to maintain about each user.  Some of this information
          is small in size, and some of it is large. Some of it you expect
          will be frequently accessed, while other information is
          infrequently accessed.
      </p>
      <p>
          Small properties are:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                  name
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  gender
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  address
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  phone number
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          Large properties are:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    image file
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  public key 1
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  public key 2
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  recorded voice greeting
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          There are several possible ways you can organize this data. How
          you should do it depends on your data access patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
          For example, suppose your application requires you to read and
          write all of the properties identified above every time you
          access a row. (This is unlikely, but it does represent the
          simplest case.) In that event, you might create a single table
          with rows containing fields for each of the properties you
          maintain for the users in your application.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, the chances are good that your application will not
          require you to access <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of a user's
          properties every time you access his information. While it is
          possible that you will always need to read all of the properties
          every time you perform a user look up, it is likely that on
          updates you will operate only on some properties.
      </p>
      <p>
          Given this, it is useful to consider how frequently data will be
          accessed, and its size. Large, infrequently accessed properties
          should be placed in tables other than that used by the frequently accessed
          properties. 
      </p>
      <p>
         For example, for the properties identified above, suppose the
         application requires: 
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                  all of the small properties to always be used whenever
                  the user's record is accessed.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  all of the large properties to be read for simple user
                  look ups.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  on user information updates, the public keys are always
                  updated (written) at the same time.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  The image file and recorded voice greeting can be updated
                  independently of everything else.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          In this case, you might store user properties using 
          a table and a child table.
          The parent table holds rows containing all the small
          properties, plus public keys. The child table contains the
          image file and voice greeting.
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">## Enter into table creation mode
table create -name userInfo
## Now add the fields
add-field -type STRING -name surname
add-field -type STRING -name familiarName
add-field -type STRING -name gender
add-field -type STRING -name street
add-field -type STRING -name city
add-field -type STRING -name state
add-field -type STRING -name zipcode
add-field -type STRING -name userPhone
add-field -type BINARY -name publickey1
add-field -type BINARY -name publickey2
primary-key -field surname -field familiarName
shard-key -field surname
## Exit table creation mode
exit
### Must add the parent table before we add the child
plan add-table -name userInfo -wait 

table create -name userInfo.largeProps
add-field -type STRING -name propType
add-field -type BINARY -name voiceGreeting
add-field -type BINARY -name imageFile
primary-key -field propType
exit
plan add-table -name userInfo.largeProps -wait </pre>
      <p>
          Because the parent table contains all the data that is accessed
          whenever user data is accessed, you can update that data all at
          once using a single atomic operation. At the same time, you avoid
          retrieving the big data values whenever you retrieve a row by
          splitting the image data and voice greeting into a child table.
      </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
              You might want to consider using the key/value API for the
              image data and voice greeting. By doing that, you can use the
              Oracle NoSQL Database large object interface, which is optimized for large
              object support. See the <em class="citetitle">Oracle NoSQL Database Getting Started with the Key/Value API</em>
              for information on working with large objects.
