        Being a distributed system, the Oracle NoSQL Database is composed
        of several software components and each expose unique
        metrics that can be monitored, interpreted, and utilized
        to understand the general health, performance, and
        operational capability of the NoSQL Database cluster.
    </p>
      <p>
        This section focuses on best practices for monitoring
        the Oracle NoSQL software components. While there are
        several software dependencies for the Oracle NoSQL Database itself
        (for example, Java virtual machine, operating system, NTP),
        this section focuses solely on the NoSQL components.
    </p>
      <p>
        There are three basic mechanisms for monitoring the health of the
        NoSQL Database:
    </p>

            <p>
                System Log File Monitoring – Oracle NoSQL Database uses the
                java.util.logging package to write all trace, information,
                and error messages to the log files for each component of
                the store. These files can be parsed using the typical log
                file probing mechanism supported by the leading system
                management solutions. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                System Monitoring Agents – Oracle NoSQL Database publishes
                MIBs for integration with SNMP based monitoring solutions
                as well as JMX Management Beans for integration with JMX
                based monitoring solutions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Application Monitoring – A good proxy for the “health”
                of the NoSQL Database rests with application level metrics. 
                Metrics like average and 90th percentile response times,
                average and 90th percentile throughput, as well average
                number of timeout exceptions encountered from NoSQL API
                calls are all potential indicators that something may be
                wrong with a component in the NoSQL cluster. In fact,
                sampling these metrics and looking for deviations from mean
                values can be the best way to know that something may be 
                wrong with your environment.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        The following sections discuss details of each of these
        monitoring techniques and illustrate how each of them can be
        utilized to detect failures in NoSQL Database components.

            The Oracle NoSQL Database is composed of the following components, and each
            component produces log files that can be monitored:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    Replication Nodes – Service read and write requests
                    from API calls. Replication nodes for a particular
                    shard are laid out on different storage nodes
                    (physical servers) by the topology manager, so the log
                    files for the nodes in each shard are spread across
                    multiple machines.
                </p>

                    Storage Node Agents – Manage the replication nodes
                    that are running on each storage node. The SNA maintains
                    its own log regarding the state of each replication
                    node it is managing. You can think of the SNA log as a
                    high level log of the replication node activity on a
                    particular storage node.

            <li>
              <p>
                    Admin Nodes – Administrative nodes handle the 
                    execution of commands from the administrative command
                    line interface. Long running plans are also staged from
                    the administrative nodes. Administrative nodes also
                    maintain a consolidated log of all the other logs in
                    the Oracle NoSQL cluster.

            All of the above mentioned log files can be found in the
            following directory structure <code class="literal">KVROOT/kvstore/log</code>
            on the machine where the component is running. The following steps 
            can be used to find the machines that are running the components of
            the cluster:
        </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                   java -jar kvstore.jar ping -host &lt;any machine
                   in the cluster&gt; -port &lt;the port number
                   used to initialize the KVStore&gt;
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                   Each storage node (snXX) is listed in the output
                   of the ping command, along with a list of
                   replication nodes (rgXX-rnXX) running on the
                   host listed in the ping output. XX denotes the
                   unique number assigned to that component by
                   NoSQL Database. For replication nodes, rg denotes
                   the shard number and stands for replication
                   group, while rn denotes the replication node
                   number within that shard.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                   Admin Nodes – Identifying the nodes in the
                   cluster that are running administrative services
                   is a bit more challenging. To identify these
                   nodes, a script would run ps axww on every host
                   in the cluster and grep for kvstore.jar and
                   -class Admin.
               </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
           The Oracle NoSQL Database maintains a single consolidated log of
           every node in the cluster, and this can be found on any of the
           nodes running an administrative service. While this is a
           convenient and easy single place to monitor for errors, it is not
           100% guaranteed. The single consolidated view is aggregated by
           getting log messages over the network, and transient network
           failures, packet loss, and high network utilization can cause
           this consolidated log to either be out of date, or have missing
           entries. Therefore, we recommend monitoring each host in the
           cluster as well as monitoring each type of log file on each host
           in the cluster.

           Generally speaking, any log message with a level of SEVERE
           should be considered a potentially critical event and worthy of
           generating a systems management notification. The sections in the
           later part of this document illustrate how to correlate
           specific SEVERE exceptions with hardware component failure.

                Oracle NoSQL Database is also monitored through SNMP or
                JMX based system management tools. For SNMP based tools,
                the Oracle NoSQL MIB is found in lib directory of the
                installation along with the JAR files for the product.
