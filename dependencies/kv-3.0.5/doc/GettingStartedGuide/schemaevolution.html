      <p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Schema evolution</em></span> is the term used for how
            the store behaves when Avro schema is changed after data has
            been written to the store using an older version of that
            schema. To change an existing schema, you update the schema
            as stored in its flat-text file, then add the new schema to the
            store using the <code class="literal">ddl add-schema</code> command with
            the <code class="literal">-evolve</code> flag.
        </p>
      <p>
            For example, if a middle name property is added to the FullName
            schema, it might be stored in a file named
            <code class="literal">schema2.avsc</code>, and then added to the store
            using the <code class="literal">ddl add-schema</code> command.
        </p>
      <p>
            Note that when you change schema, the new field must be given a
            default value. This prevents errors when clients using an old
            version of the schema create new values that will be missing
            the new field:
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">{
   "type": "record",
   "namespace": "com.example",
   "name": "FullName",
   "fields": [
     { "name": "first", "type": "string" },
     <strong class="userinput"><code>{ "name": "middle", "type": "string", "default": "" },</code></strong>
     { "name": "last", "type": "string" }
   ]
 }</pre>
      <p>
            These are the modifications you can safely
            perform to your schema without any concerns:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">

            Beyond these kind of changes, there are unsafe changes that you
            can do which will either cause the schema to be rejected when
            you attempt to add it to the store, or which can be performed
            so long as you are careful about how you go about upgrading
            clients which use the schema. These type of issues are
            identified when you try to modify (evolve) schema that is
            currently enabled in the store. See
            <a class="xref" href="provideschema.html#change-schema-in-store" title="Changing Schema">Changing Schema</a>
            for details.

                There are a few rules you need to remember if you are
                modifying schema that is already in use in your store:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        For best results, always provide a default value
                        for the fields in your schema. This makes it
                        possible to delete fields later on if you decide it
                        is necessary. <span class="emphasis"><em>If you do not provide a
                            default value for a field, you cannot delete
                            that field from your schema.</em></span>
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        You cannot change a field's data type. If you have
                        decided that a field should be some data type other
                        than what it was originally created using, then add
                        a whole new field to your schema that uses the
                        appropriate data type.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        When adding a field to your schema, you must
                        provide a default value for the field.

                        You cannot rename an existing field. However, if
                        you want to access the field by some name other
                        than what it was originally created using, add and
                        use aliases for the field.
                    </p>

                When a schema is changed, multiple versions of the schema will
                exist and be maintained by the store. The version of the schema
                used to serialize a value, before writing it to the store, is
                called the <span class="emphasis"><em>writer schema</em></span>. The writer
                schema is specified by the application when creating a binding.
                It is associated with the value when calling the binding's
                <code class="methodname">AvroBinding.toValue()</code> method to
                serialize the data. This writer schema is associated internally
                with every stored value.
            </p>
        <p>
                The <span class="emphasis"><em>reader schema</em></span> is used to
                deserialize a value after reading it from the store. Like
                the writer schema, the reader schema is specified by the
                client application when creating a binding. It is used to
                deserialize the data when calling the binding's
                <code class="methodname">AvroBinding.toObject()</code> method,
                after reading a value from the store.

                Schema evolution is the automatic transformation of Avro
                schema. This transformation is between the version of the
                schema that the client is using (its local copy), and what
                is currently contained in the store.  When the local copy
                of the schema is not identical to the schema used to write the
                value (that is, when the reader schema is different from
                the writer schema), this data transformation is performed.
                When the reader schema matches the schema used to write the
                value, no transformation is necessary.
            </p>
        <p>
                Schema evolution is applied only during deserialization.
                If the reader schema is different from the value's writer
                schema, then the value is automatically modified during
                deserialization to conform to the reader schema. To do
                this, default values are used.
            </p>
        <p>
                There are two cases to consider when using schema
                evolution: when you add a field and when you delete a
                field. Schema evolution takes care of both scenarios, so
                long as you originally assigned default values to the
                fields that were deleted, and assigned default values to
                the fields that were added.
            </p>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">

                <h4 class="title"><a id="schemaevo-add"></a>Adding Fields</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
                    Suppose you had the following schema:
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">{
    "type" : "record",
    "name" : "userInfo",
    "namespace" : "my.example",
    "fields" : [{"name" : "name", "type" : "string", "default" : ""}]
} </pre>
          <p>
                    In version 2 of the schema, you add a field:
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">{
    "type" : "record",
    "name" : "userInfo",
    "namespace" : "my.example",
    "fields" : [{"name" : "name", "type" : "string", "default" : ""},
                {"name" : "age", "type" : "int" , "default" : -1}]
                
} </pre>
          <p>
                    In this scenario, a client that is using the new schema
                    can deserialize a value that uses the old schema, even
                    though the age field will be missing from the value.
                    Upon deserialization, the value retrieved from the
                    store will be automatically transformed such that the
                    age field is contained in the value. The age field will
                    be set to the default value, which is -1 in this case.
                </p>
          <p>
                    The reverse also works. A client that is using the old
                    version of the schema attempts can deserialize a value
                    that was written using the new version of the schema.
                    In this case, the value retrieved from the store
                    contains the age field, which from the client
                    perspective is unexpected. So upon deserialization the
                    age field is automatically removed from the retrieved
                    object.
                </p>
          <p>
                    This has ramifications if you change your schema, and
                    then have clients concurrently running that are using
                    different schema versions. This scenario is not unusual
                    in a large, distributed system of the type that Oracle NoSQL Database
                    supports. 
                </p>
          <p>
                    In this scenario, you might see fields revert to their
                    default value, even though no client has explicitly
                    touched those fields. This can happen in the following
                    way:
                </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                            Client v.2 creates a my.example.userInfo
                            record, and sets the age field to 38. Then it
                            writes that value to the store. Client v.2 is
                            using schema version 2.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Client v.1 reads the record. It is using
                            version 1 of the schema, so the age field is
                            automatically removed from the value during
                            deserialization.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            Client v.1 modifies the name field and then
                            writes the record back to the store. When it
                            does this, the age field is missing from the
                            value that it writes to the store.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Client v.2 reads the record again. Because the
                            age field is missing from the record (because
                            Client v.1 last wrote it), the age field is set
                            to the default value, which is -1. This means
                            that the value of the age field has reverted to
                            the default, even though no client explicitly
                            modified it.

                    Field deletion works largely the same way as field
                    addition, with the same concern for field values
                    automatically reverting to the default. Suppose you had
                    the following trivial schema:
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">{
    "type" : "record",
    "name" : "userInfo",
    "namespace" : "my.example",
    "fields" : [{"name" : "name", "type" : "string", "default" : ""},
                {"name" : "age", "type" : "int" , "default" : -1}]
                
} </pre>
          <p>
                    In version 2 of the schema, you delete the age field:
                </p>
          <pre class="programlisting">{
    "type" : "record",
    "name" : "userInfo",
    "namespace" : "my.example",
    "fields" : [{"name" : "name", "type" : "string", "default" : ""}]
} </pre>
          <p>
                    In this scenario, a client that is using the new schema
                    can deserialize a value that uses the old schema, even
                    though the age field is contained in that value. In
                    this case, the age field is silently removed from the
                    value during deserialization.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Further, a client that is using the old
                    version of the schema attempts can deserialize a value that
                    uses the new version of the schema. In this case, the value
                    retrieved from the store does not contain the age
                    field. So upon deserialization, the age field is
                    automatically inserted into the schema (because the
                    reader schema requires it) and the default value is
                    used for the newly inserted field.
                </p>
          <p>
                    As with adding fields, this has ramifications if you
                    change your schema, and then have clients concurrently
                    running that are using different schema versions. 
                </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                            Client v.1 creates a my.example.userInfo
                            record, and sets the age field to 38. Then it
                            writes that value to the store. Client v.1 is
                            using schema version 1.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Client v.2 reads the record. It is using
                            version 2 of the schema, so it is not expecting
                            the age field. As a result, the age field is
                            automatically stripped from the value during
                            deserialization.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            Client v.2 modifies the name field and then
                            writes the record back to the store. When it
                            does this, the age field is missing from the
                            value that it writes to the store.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Client v.1 reads the record again. Because the
                            age field is missing from the record (because
                            Client v.2 last wrote it), the age field is
                            automatically inserted into the value, using
                            the default of -1. This means that the value of
                            the age field has reverted to the default, even
                            though no client explicitly modified it.
