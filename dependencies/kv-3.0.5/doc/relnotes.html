<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Oracle NoSQL Database is a distributed key-value store capable of scaling
horizontally to handle very large amounts of data.
</p>
<p>
Oracle NoSQL Database is compatible with Java SE 7 and later, and has
been tested and certified against Oracle JDK 7u51. We encourage you to
upgrade to the latest Java releases to take advantage of the latest bug 
fixes and performance improvements.
</p>
<p>
Attempting to use this release with a version of Java earlier than Java
7 will produce an error message similar to:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
  oracle/kv/impl/util/KVStoreMain : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
This is release 12cR1.3.0.5 Enterprise Edition of Oracle NoSQL Database. It follows
major release 2.0.23, minor release 2.1.8, and patch releases 2.1.19,
2.1.24, 2.1.54, and 2.1.57.

<h3>New in Release 3.0</h3>
<p>
This release of Oracle NoSQL Database adds several new features
including user/password authentication and network security, 
secondary zones, and support for typed data, a tabular data model,
and secondary indexes on table fields.  For a complete listing of all
the changes made to Oracle NoSQL Database for this release (including
all bug fixes) see the <a
href="changelog.html">change log</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
Support for password-based authentication of NoSQL clients and for
secure communications using SSL to both the CE and EE versions of the
product.  


New features include:
<ul>
<li>
A security configuration utility to configure and add security to a new
or existing Oracle NoSQL Database installation.
</li><li>
Authentication methods to provide password authentication for users and systems.
</li><li>
Encryption of data on the network to prevent unauthorized access to that data.
</li><li>
External password storage to support unattended application
start-up. Passwords may be stored on disk. The EE version of the
product also includes the ability to use the Oracle Wallet mechanism
for password storage.
</li><li>
Security policies for ensuring a secure environment.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This feature is described in greater depth in the Security Guide, as
well as in the Administrators Guide and product Javadoc.

<h4>Secondary Zones</h4>
<p>
Support for secondary zones has been added. 
<p>
Zone is the new name for datacenter, with the new name meant to
clarify that these node groupings may not always coincide with
physical data centers.  A zone is a collection of nodes that have good
network connectivity with each other and have some level of physical
separation from nodes in other zones.
<p>
The new secondary zone feature permits the deployment of zones which
can be used to make a copy of the data available at a distant
location, or to maintain an extra copy of the data to increase
redundancy or read capacity.
<p>
This feature is described in greater depth in the Administrators Guide.
</p>

<h4>Table API</h4>
<p>
The new Table API includes a set of data types and a tabular data
model using those types. It lets you manipulate data using a tables
metaphor, which organizes data in columns. An unlimited number of
subtables are supported by this API. It is possible to create
secondary indices to improve query speeds against your tables.
<p>
Tables and indexes are defined using the administrative CLI and
accessed via programmatic API. The data CLI has been enhanced to
perform operations on tables and indexes as well. The API is
documented in the Oracle NoSQL Database javadoc, and is found primarily in
the oracle.kv.table package.
<p>
It is possible to define tables that overlay data created with NoSQL
DB Release 2 if that data was created using a conforming Avro
schema. This overlay is required in order to create secondary indexes
on conforming Release 2 data.
<p>
This feature is described in greater depth in the Getting Started with
the Tables API guide.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This release of Oracle NoSQL Database comes in three distributions:
    Community Edition (CE), Enterprise Edition (EE), and Client.
</p>
<p>
    The CE version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Affero General Public License (aGPL v3). It
    includes the client and server distribution, but does not include
    some server features.
</p>
<p>
    The EE version does not include source code and it ships with an
    Oracle license. The EE version includes the client and server
    distribution, and includes several features not found in the CE version:
    SNMP support for monitoring the store, Oracle External Tables
    support, and Oracle Wallet support for external password storage.
</p>
<p>
    The Client version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Apache 2.0 License (Apache 2.0).  The Client
    version only contains the implementation of the client API, which
    may be used to access servers running under either CE or EE.
</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>
In the Community Edition, the build.xml file is known to not work properly for building from source.
