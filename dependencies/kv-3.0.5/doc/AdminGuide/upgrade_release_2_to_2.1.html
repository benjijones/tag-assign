              Upgrading a store from release 2 to release 3 can be
              accomplished one Storage Node at a time because a mix of
              release 2 and 3 Storage Nodes are permitted to run
              simultaneously in the same store. This allows you to
              strategically upgrade Storage Nodes in the most efficient
              manner.

        <p>
                  Upgrading a 1.0 store directly to release 3 is not
                  supported. You must upgrade your store from 1.0 to 2.0
                  before upgrading to release 3. For instructions on how to
                  upgrade your 1.0 store, see

        <p>
                  If your store contains more than a handful of Storage
                  Nodes, you may want to perform your upgrade using a
                  script. See 
                  <a class="xref" href="upgrade_release_2_to_2.1.html#scriptto21" title="Using a Script to Upgrade to Release 3">Using a Script to Upgrade to Release 3</a>

      <p>
              To avoid potential problems, new CLI commands are available
              to identify when nodes can be upgraded at the same time.
              These commands are described in the following procedure.
          </p>
      <p>
              To upgrade your store, start by installing the release 3
              software on a Storage Node that is running an admin service.
              The new CLI commands require an updated admin service in
              order to function.
          </p>
      <p>
              Do the following:
          </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                      On a Storage Node running a release 2 admin service:
                  </p>
            <div class="orderedlist">
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  <p>
                              Place the updated software in a new KVHOME
                              directory on a Storage Node running the admin
                              service. The new KVHOME directory is referred to here as
                              NEW_KVHOME. If nodes share this directory using
                              NFS, this only needs to be done once for each
                              shared directory.
                          </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                              Stop the Storage Node using the release 2 CLI. When you do this, this
                              shuts down the admin service on that Storage Node. 
                          </p>
                  <p>
                              If you have configured the node to automatically
                              start the Storage Node Agent on reboot using
                              /etc/init.d, Upstart, or some other mechanism
                              first modify that script to point to NEW_KVHOME. 
                          </p>
                  <p>
                              Once you have modified that script, shutdown the
                              Storage Node:
                          </p>
                  <pre class="programlisting">java -Xmx256m -Xms256m \

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                              Restart the Storage Node using the release
                              3 code:
                          </p>
                  <pre class="programlisting">nohup java -Xmx256m -Xms256m \
-jar NEW_KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar start -root &lt;kvroot&gt;&amp; </pre>
                  <p>
                              (If the system is configured to
                              automatically restart the Storage Node Agent,
                              this step may not be necessary.)
                          </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                              Use the CLI to connect to the Storage Node
                              which is now running the release 3 code:
                          </p>
                  <pre class="programlisting">java -Xmx256m -Xms256m \

                                Verify that all the Storage Nodes in the store are
                                running the proper software level required to
                                upgrade to release 3. Note that any patch release
                                level of 2.0 or 2.1 meets the minimum software level
                                requirements.

                  <p>
                               Note that only a partial sample of the
                               verification command's output is shown here.
                               The important part is the last line, which
                               shows no violations.
                           </p>
                  <p>
                               The most likely reason for a violation is if
                               you are (accidentally) attempting a
                               release level downgrade. For example, it is
                               illegal to downgrade from a
                               higher minor release to a lower minor
                               release. Possibly this is occurring simply
                               because you are running the CLI using a
                               package at a minor release level that is
                               lower than the release level at other nodes
                               in the store. 
                           </p>

                    <p>
                                   It is legal to downgrade from a higher
                                   <span class="emphasis"><em>patch</em></span> level to a
                                   lower patch level. So, for example
                                   downgrading from 2.1.4 to 2.1.3 would be
                                   legal, while downgrading from 2.1.3 to
                                   2.0.39 would not be legal.
                               </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                               Also, a violation will occur if you attempt
                               to upgrade 1.0 nodes directly to release 3. When
                               upgrading a 1.0 store, you must first
                               upgrade to 2.0, and then upgrade to
                               release 3.
                               For more information on upgrading a 1.0
                               store, see

                  <p>
                               In any case, if the <code class="literal">verify prerequisite</code>
                               command shows violations, resolve the
                               situation before you attempt to upgrade the
                               identified nodes.

                      command. Those nodes which have been upgraded are
                      identified with a verification message that includes
                      the current software version number:

                        Those nodes which still need to be upgraded are

                        upgrade is still necessary:

                        Second, the very end of the verification output

                            If the verification shows nodes you thought
                            were upgraded as being still in need of an
                            upgrade, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> resolve
                            that problem before upgrading the other nodes
                            in your store. As a kind of a sanity check, you
                            can verify just those nodes you just finished

                      Continue doing this until all Storage Nodes have been

        <p>
                    For any deployments with more than a handful of Storage
                    Nodes, the manual upgrade procedure described above
                    becomes problematic. In that case, you should probably
                    upgrade your store using a script.
                </p>
        <p>
                    An example script (bash shell script) is available for
                    you to examine in the release 3 distribution. It can be found
                    here:
                </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&lt;KVROOT&gt;/examples/upgrade/onlineUpgrade</pre>
        <p>
                    This script has the same upgrade restrictions as was
                    described earlier in this section: it will only upgrade
                    a release 2 installation to release 3, and your store must have a
                    replication factor of at least 3 in order for your
                    store to be available during the upgrade process.
                </p>
        <p>
                    The provided script is an example only. It must be
                    modified in order for it to properly function for your
                    installation.
                </p>
        <p>
                    Note that the script does not perform any software
                    provisioning for you. This means you are responsible
                    for placing the release 3 package on your host machines in
                    whatever location you are using for your installation
                    software. That said, the script communicates with your
                    host machines using ssh, so you could potentially
                    enhance the script to provision your machines using
                    scp. 
                </p>
        <p>
                    Because the script uses ssh, in order for it to
                    function you must configure your machines to allow
                    automatic login (that is, login over ssh without a
                    password). ssh supports public/private key
                    authentication, so this is generally a secure way to
                    operate. 
                </p>
        <p>

                    this way, see
