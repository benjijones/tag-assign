            Typical errors when bringing up a store are typos and
            misconfiguration.  It is also possible to run into network port
            conflicts, especially if the deployment failed and you are
            starting over.  In that case be sure to remove all partial
            store data and configuration and kill any remnant processes.
            Processes associated with a store as reported by "jps -m" are
            one of these:
        </p>
      <table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list">
        <tr>
          <td>StorageNodeAgentImpl</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ManagedService</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
            If you kill the StorageNodeAgentImpl it should also kill its
            managed processes.
        </p>
      <p>
            You can use the monitoring tab in the Admin Console to look at
            various log files.
        </p>
      <p>
            There are detailed log files available in
            <code class="literal">KVROOT/storename/log</code> as well as logs of the
            bootstrap process in <code class="literal">KVROOT/*.log</code>.  The
            bootstrap logs are most useful in diagnosing initial startup
            problems.  The logs in <code class="literal">storename/log</code> appear
            once the store has been configured.  The logs on the host
            chosen for the admin process are the most detailed and include
            a store-wide consolidated log file:
            <code class="literal">KVROOT/storename/log/storename_*.log</code>
        </p>
      <p>
            Each line in a log file is prefixed with the date of the message,
            its severity, and the name of the component which issued it. For
            example:
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">2012-10-25 14:28:26.982 UTC INFO [admin1] Initializing Admin for store:
kvstore </pre>
      <p>
            When looking for more context for events at a given time, use
            the timestamp and component name to narrow down the section of
            log to peruse.
        </p>
      <p>
            Error messages in the logs show up with "SEVERE" in them so you
            can grep for that if you are troubleshooting.  SEVERE error
            messages are also displayed in the Admin's Topology tab, in the
            CLI's <code class="literal">show events</code> command, and when you use
            the <code class="literal">ping</code> command.
        </p>
      <p>
            In addition to log files, these directories may also contain
            *.perf files, which are performance files for the Replication
            Nodes.
        </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

        <p>
              As your store operates, you can discover information about
              any problems that may be occurring by looking at the plan
              history and by looking at error logs.
            </p>
        <p>
              The plan history indicates if any configuration or
              operational actions you attempted to take against the store
              encountered problems. This information is available as the
              plan executes and finishes. Errors are reported in the plan
              history each time an attempt to run the plan fails. The plan
              history can be seen using the CLI <code class="literal">show plan</code>
              command, or in the Admin's <code class="literal">Plan History</code>
              tab.
            </p>
        <p>
              Other problems may occur asynchronously. You can learn about
              unexpected failures, service downtime, and performance issues
              through the Admin's critical events display in the Logs tab,
              or through the CLI's <code class="literal">show events</code> command.
              Events come with a time stamp, and the description may
              contain enough information to diagnose the issue. In other
              cases, more context may be needed, and the administrator may
              want to see what else happened around that time.
            </p>
        <p>
              The store-wide log consolidates logging output from all
              services. Browsing this file might give you a more complete
              view of activity during the problem period. It can be viewed
              using the Admin's Logs tab, by using the CLI's
              <code class="literal">logtail</code> command, or by directly viewing
              the &lt;storename&gt;_N.log file in the
              &lt;KVHOME&gt;/&lt;storename&gt;/log directory. It is also
              possible to download the store-wide log file using the Admin's
              Logs tab.

                Oracle NoSQL Database uses three different types of services, all of which
                should be running correctly in order for your store to be
                in a healthy state. The three service types are the Admin,
                Storage Nodes, and Replication Nodes. You should have
                multiple instances of these services running throughout
                your store.
            </p>
        <p>
                Each service has a status that can be viewed using any of
                the following:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>

                    </p>

            <li>
              <p>

                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
              The status values can be one of the following:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>

              <p>
                        The service is coming up.
                    </p>

              <p>
                        The service is running normally.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

                    </p>
              <p>
                        The service is stopping. This may take some time as
                        some services can be involved in time-consuming
                        activities when they are asked to stop.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">WAITING_FOR_DEPLOY</code>
                    </p>
              <p>
                        The service is waiting for commands or
                        acknowledgments from other services during its
                        startup processing. If it is a Storage Node, it is
                        waiting for the initial deploy-SN command. Other
                        services should transition out of this phase
                        without any administrative intervention from the
                        user.

                    </p>
              <p>
                        The service was stopped intentionally and cleanly.

                    </p>
              <p>
                      The service is in an error state. Oracle NoSQL Database attempts
                      to restart the service.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

                    </p>
              <p>
                      The service is in an error state and is not automatically
                      restarted. Administrative intervention is required.

                    </p>
              <p>
                      The service is not reachable by the Admin. If the status
                      was seen using a command issued by the Admin, this
                      state may mask a STOPPED or ERROR state.

        </div>
        <p>
                A healthy service begins with <code class="literal">STARTING</code>.
                It may transition to <code class="literal">WAITING_FOR_DEPLOY</code>
                for a short period before going on to
                <code class="literal">RUNNING</code>.
            </p>
        <p>
                <code class="literal">ERROR_RESTARTING</code> and
                <code class="literal">ERROR_NO_RESTART</code> indicate that there has
                been a problem that should be investigated.  An
                <code class="literal">UNREACHABLE</code> service may only be in that
                state temporarily, although if that state persists, the
                service may be truly in an
                <code class="literal">ERROR_RESTARTING</code> or
                <code class="literal">ERROR_NO_RESTART</code> state.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that the Admin's Topology tab only shows abnormal
                service statuses. A service that is
                <code class="literal">RUNNING</code> does not display its status in
                that tab.

                        Reports the status of the store running on the
                        specified host and port.  This command can be used
                        against any of the host and port pairs used for
                        Storage Nodes.
