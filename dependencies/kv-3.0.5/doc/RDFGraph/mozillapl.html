            5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate
            automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms.
            However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under
            this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a)

            some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back
            into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular

            notice of non-compliance with this License from such
            Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
            Your receipt of the notice.

            5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting
            a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
            actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a
            Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
            Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this
            License shall terminate.

            survive termination.

            <span class="bold"><strong>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</strong></span>
        </p>
      <p>
            Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"
            basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied,
            or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that
            the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for
            a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to
            the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with
            You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any
            respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any
            necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
            warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use
            of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except
            under this disclaimer.

            <span class="bold"><strong>7. Limitation of Liability</strong></span>
        </p>
      <p>
            Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
            (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
            Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
            permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
            special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
            including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss
            of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
            any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such
            party shall have been informed of the possibility of such
            damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
            liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
            party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
            limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
            limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
            exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

            <span class="bold"><strong>8. Litigation</strong></span>
        </p>
      <p>
            Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in
            the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its
            principal place of business and such litigation shall be
            governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its
            conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
            prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
            counter-claims.

      <p>
            <span class="bold"><strong>9. Miscellaneous</strong></span>
        </p>
      <p>
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
            subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held
            to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
            the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
            this License against a Contributor.

      <p>
            You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received the
            Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version
            published by the license steward.

        </p>
      <p>
            If you create software not governed by this License, and you
            want to create a new license for such software, you may create
            and use a modified version of this License if you rename the
            license and remove any references to the name of the license
            steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
            this License).
