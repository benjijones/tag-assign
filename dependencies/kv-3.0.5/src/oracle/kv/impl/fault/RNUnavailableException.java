/**
 * Thrown when an RN could not be located to satisfy a Request. The exception
 * typically results in the operation being retried transparently at the
 * KVClient, until the request succeeds or the request times out.
 * <p>
 * These retries are typically done when a request needs a Master and an
 * election is in progress. If the election can be concluded before the request
 * timeouts, then the retry is largely transparent to the client.
