/**
 * A KVStore client application that illustrates basic schema design.  It also
 * shows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> multi-component Keys with major and minor paths;
 * <li> single-attribute and multi-attribute Values;
 * <li> Avro serialization of Value attributes;
 * <li> storing a Value associated with a parent Key;
 * <li> using putIfVersion to avoid lost updates;
 * <li> using timestamps as Key components;
 * <li> querying a range of Key values;
 * <li> updating multiple Key/Value pairs in an atomic operation;
 * <li> using a RunOperation class to handle exceptions consistently;
 * <li> using a WriteOperations class to retry write operations to account for
 *      transient network failures.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To understand this example, start by reading the {@link
 * KeyDefinition} class comments.  These comments explain the overall
 * schema, key types and data object types.  Then come back and
 * continue reading this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since this example uses an Avro binding, the Avro and Jackson jars must
 * be in the classpath, as well as the kvclient jar.  The Avro and Jackson jars
 * are included in the KVHOME/lib directory along with the kvclient jar:</p>
 * <pre>
 *    kvclient.jar avro.jar jackson-core-asl.jar jackson-mapper-asl.jar
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>As long as all four jars are in the same directory, only the kvclient jar
 * needs to be specified in the classpath, because the kvclient jar references
 * the other three jars.  If they are not in the same directory, all four
 * jars must be explicitly specified in the classpath.</p>
 *
 * <p>To build this example in the examples/avro directory:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   cd KVHOME/examples/schema
 *   mkdir classes
 *   javac -cp KVHOME/lib/kvclient.jar -d classes *.java
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Before running this example program, start a KVStore instance.  The
 * simplest way to do that is to run KV Lite as described in the Quickstart
 * document.</p>
 *
 * <p>After starting the KVStore instance, the Avro schemas used by the example
 * must be added to the store using the administration command line interface
 * (CLI).  First start the admin CLI as described in the Oracle NoSQL Database
 * Administrator's Guide. Then enter the following commands to add the example
 * schemas:</p>
 * <pre>
 *  ddl add-schema -file user-info.avsc
 *  ddl add-schema -file user-image.avsc
 *  ddl add-schema -file login-session.avsc
 *  ddl add-schema -file login-summary.avsc
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>After adding the schema, use the KVStore instance name, host and port for
 * running this program, as follows:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * java schema.SchemaExample -store &lt;instance name&gt; \
 *                           -host  &lt;host name&gt;     \
 *                           -port  &lt;port number&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For all examples the default instance name is kvstore, the
 * default host name is localhost and the default port number is 5000.
 * These defaults match the defaults for the run-kvlite.sh script, so the
 * simplest way to run the examples along with kvlite is to omit all
 * parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>When running this program, the Java classpath must include the
 * kvclient.jar and the example 'classes' directory. The .avsc files must also
 * be found as resources in the classpath, which can be accomplished by adding
 * the 'examples' directory to the classpath or by copying the .avsc files to
 * the 'classes/schema' directory.</p>
 *
 * <p>This program adds a fixed set of Key/Value pairs to the store
 * and then performs queries and prints the results of the queries.
 * It is not interactive.</p>
 *
 * <p>This program is a usage example and is not intended to be used
 * directly for performance testing.  The methods that access the
 * store make some assumptions that access is single-client and
 * single-threaded.  However, the schema approach -- the key
 * structure, object definitions and object serialization -- is
 * intended to scale up and is an example of a design for a large data
 * set with stringent performance requirements.</p>
 *
 * <p>WARNING: To create a performance test, a multi-client
 * multi-threaded client approach will be necessary to avoid limiting
 * throughput at the client side.  This example program is not
 * designed for that type of testing.</p>

     * worth the added complexity.
