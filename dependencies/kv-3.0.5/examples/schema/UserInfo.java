/**
 * Holds the collection of user attributes that is stored as the
 * {@code Value} for the "/user/EMAIL/-/info" {@code Key}.
 * Illustrates the use of a multi-attribute Key/Value pair.
 *
 * <p>Memory and disk overhead is reduced when storing multiple
 * attributes in a single {@code Value}, compared to storing each
 * individual attribute as a separate Key/Value pair.  The
 * multi-attribute approach is appropriate when more than one
 * attribute is often accessed at a time, and the attributes are
 * generally small.  When a large attribute is not typically accessed
 * along with other attributes, it is generally better to store it as
 * a separate Key/Value pair; for example, see the {@link UserImage}
 * class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements serialization and deserialization of its
 * attributes as a {@code Value} object. A {@code Value} object is
 * used to access a Key/Value pair, and is really just a wrapper for a
 * byte array.</p>
 *
 * <p>To translate attributes to and from the byte array, the standard
 * Java {@code DataOutputStream} and {@code DataInputStream} classes
 * are used.  It is important to minimize the size of the byte array,
 * and {@code DataOutput} and {@code DataInput} provide low-level
 * methods for optimizing the storage size.  Of course, many other
 * serialization techniques are available, and the use of {@code
 * DataOutputStream} and {@code DataInputStream} is only used here as
 * one example.</p>
 *
 * <p>Standard Java serialization is not recommended because of the
 * large per-object overhead that would be repeated in every {@code
 * Value} containing objects of the same class.  Even when using the
 * {@code Externalizable} approach, the class name is stored with each
 * object.  This redundancy is not appropriate for large scale data
 * storage.</p>
 *
 * <p>In a real application, provisions should be made for schema versioning.
 * Schema versioning is beyond the scope of this example and the serialization
 * format used here contains no version information.</p>
