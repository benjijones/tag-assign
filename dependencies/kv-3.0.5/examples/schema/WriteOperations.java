/**
 * Performs write operations and retries the operation when a {@link
 * FaultException} occurs in order to handle transient network failures.  While
 * the {@link KVStore} read methods perform retries automatically when a
 * network failure occurs, the {@link KVStore} write methods do not.
 * Therefore, it is recommended that write operations are performed using the
 * methods in this class, or using a similar retry mechanism in the
 * application.
 * <p>
 * The KVStore write methods are not defined to be strictly idempotent which
 * means if they are performed more than once, the outcome may be different
 * than if they were performed a single time. Repeating an operation may occur
 * when it is retried after a network failure, if in fact the operation was
 * successful the first time. Because of the network failure, the client is
 * unaware of whether the first operation failed or succeeded.
 * <p>
 * For example, if {@link KVStore#delete KVStore.delete} throws a
 * FaultException due to a network failure, it may or may not have succeeded.
 * Imagine that it did succeed and the network failure occurred when receiving
 * the operation reply message.  When the KVStore.delete call is retried, it
 * will return false because the previous attempt succeeded.  Of course, this
 * can also occur if another client deletes the record, even when no retries
 * are necessary.  Therefore, the semantics of the {@link #delete delete}
 * method in this class are slightly different than the semantics of {@link
 * KVStore#delete KVStore.delete}.  The delete method here does not return an
 * indication of whether it deleted the record.  The record is guaranteed to be
 * deleted when the delete method returns without an exception, but there is no
 * way to know whether it was deleted by this method or another client.  With
 * this change in semantics, the delete method in this class is idempotent.
 * <p>
 * Several methods in this class fall into the same category as the delete
 * method in that they are idempotent, as they are defined here.  These are:
 * {@link #put put}, {@link #delete delete} and {@link #multiDelete
 * multiDelete}.  When these methods return without an exception, their outcome
 * is always the same, whether or not retries were necessary. For that reason,
 * retrying these methods at the application level is not needed when no
 * exception is thrown.
 * <p>
 * Most of the other methods in this class -- {@link #putIfAbsent putIfAbsent},
 * {@link #putIfPresent putIfPresent}, {@link #putIfVersion putIfVersion} and
 * {@link #deleteIfVersion deleteIfVersion} -- fall into a different category.
 * These methods are not idempotent, even as defined here, because the
 * application needs to decide whether the operations need to be retried in the
 * face of concurrent access.
 * <p>
 * For example, say the application performs a {@link KVStore#get KVStore.get},
 * examines the record value and determines that it qualifies for deletion, and
 * then calls {@link #deleteIfVersion deleteIfVersion}.  Say the call to
 * KVStore.deleteIfVersion succeeds (when first called by the deleteIfVersion
 * method here), but throws a FaultException due to a network failure. When the
 * KVStore.deleteIfVersion call is retried, it returns false because the
 * previous attempt succeeded and the record was deleted as a result; the
 * deleteIfVersion method in this class will return false as well.  Of course,
 * this can also occur if another client has deleted or modified the record,
 * even when no retries are necessary.  Therefore, the meaning of a false
 * return value from the deleteIfVersion method in this class is slightly
 * different than for KVStore.deleteIfVersion.  When false is returned by the
 * deleteIfVersion method here, it may be because another client deleted or
 * modified the record, or because <em>this method</em> itself unknowingly
 * deleted the record and then retried the operation.  Either way, the
 * application should normally retry the higher level operation: call
 * KVStore.get again (or use the prevValue parameter of the deleteIfVersion
 * method) to get the current record value, and examine it again to see if the
 * record still qualifies for deletion.  In the example described, the record
 * will no longer exist and the application should assume that it was deleted
 * by another client or by this method itself; these two cases cannot be
 * distinguished.
 * <p>
 * As an illustration of the difference in semantics, imagine a store that is
 * idle except for a single client thread that is performing KVStore.get and
 * deleteIfVersion calls (the method in this class).  We also guarantee that no
 * data migration takes place in this test, since data migration changes record
 * versions as if another client performed an update.  In this test, one might
 * assume that the deleteIfVersion method should always return true, since no
 * other clients are accessing the store.  However, this is an incorrect
 * assumption.  If the test is run for long enough, transient network failures
 * will eventually occur, and deleteIfVersion will return false due to
 * scenarios such as the one described above.  This may be an unexpected
 * outcome in such a test scenario, but should be expected in a real world
 * application due to other client activity and data migration, as well as
 * network failures.
 * <p>
 * The following example is also noteworthy.  Imagine that {@link #putIfVersion
 * putIfVersion} is used to increment or decrement a bank balance, or make
 * another sort of incremental or conditional update.  If null is returned by
 * the putIfVersion method in this class (or if {@link KVStore#putIfVersion
 * KVStore.putIfVersion} throws a FaultException), this means the operation may
 * or may not have succeeded.  If performing the change exactly once is
 * critical, as it would be when incrementing or decrementing a bank balance,
 * the application must build in some means of determining whether the change
 * succeeded or not.  This explains why putIfVersion and similar methods in
 * this class cannot simply compare the currently stored value to the value
 * requested, to determine whether the operation succeeded.  The test for
 * success or failure must be left to the application in such cases.
 * <p>
 * The execute method is a special case, since it doesn't fall neatly into one
 * of the two categories defined: idempotent like delete, or non-idempotent
 * like deleteIfVersion.  This is because execute can be used to perform a
 * combination of delete and deleteIfVersion, as well as other types of write
 * operations.  The execute method in this class will retry KVStore.execute
 * when a FaultException is thrown, and the meaning of the individual operation
 * results will depend on the type of operation, as defined by the other
 * methods in this class.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class does not do any exception handling, other than to retry
 * the operation after any kind of FaultException is thrown.  Up to {@link
 * #N_RETRIES} (currently two) retries are performed, and a FaultException that
 * occurs in the last attempt is propagated to the caller.  The caller should
 * handle the exception as described in the {@link RunOperation} class in this
 * example.  In this example, calls to methods in this class are always made
 * within the context of a RunOperation execution, and exceptions are handled
 * by RunOperation in all cases.
 * <p>
 * A known deficiency of this class is that a network failure is not
 * distinguished from other types of FaultExceptions that might occur; a retry
 * is performed when any type of FaultException is thrown.  This is not
 * considered a major problem for two reasons: a) other types of failures are
 * likely to be persistent and will quickly occur again when retrying, and b)
 * optimizing performance when handling FaultExceptions is not normally a
 * concern.
