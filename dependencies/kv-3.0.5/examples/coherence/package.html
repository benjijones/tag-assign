<body>
Two client applications that illustrate integration of Oracle NoSQL DB with
Oracle Coherence.
<p>
The code can be found in KVHOME/examples/coherence/.  There are two separate
examples in this directory:
<pre>
 BinaryStoreExample.java
 AvroSpecificExample.java
</pre>
Each of these demonstrates the use of a different type of store interface:
{@link oracle.kv.coherence.NoSQLBinaryStore}, and {@link oracle.kv.coherence.NoSQLAvroCacheStore}.
<p>
A comparison of the two types of store interfaces is found in their javadoc.
It is also useful to compare the two examples side by side to see the
differences.
<p>
Instructions for building and running each example are at the top of each
example source file.
