/**
 * This is a simple Oracle NoSQL Database client application that demonstrates
 * an integration of an Avro Schema-based Oracle NoSQL Database application
 * with Oracle Coherence.  This example uses the {@link NoSQLAvroCacheStore}
 * module, which is a pre-built implementation of the Oracle Coherence
 * {@link CacheStore} interface to manage interaction with with an Oracle NoSQL
 * Database instance.
 * <p>
 * Objects that are manipulated by an Oracle Coherence application need to be
 * serialized when moving them between the application space and the Oracle
 * Coherence cache, as well as between the Oracle Coherence cache and a
 * {@link CacheStore} implementation.  Oracle Coherence supports a variety of
 * mechanisms for doing this, including multiple native Java Serialization
 * techniques, multiple Oracle Coherence Portable Object Format techniques, and
 * the ability to use user-provided serialization implementations.  This
 * example demonstrates the use of the {@link NoSQLAvroSerializer}
 * implementation for object serialization.  This mechanism uses the fast and
 * compact Avro serialization format to enable applications to be quickly moved
 * to Oracle Coherence.
 * <p>
 * Because this example assumes that an application is built using Avro schemas,
 * the reader should already be familiar with Avro Schemas.  It is suggested
 * that you review the examples in the avro example directory if you are not
 * yet familiar with the use of Avro schemas.
 * <p>
 * As with the SpecificExample program from the avro example directory, this
 * examples uses an Ant build file to generate application classes from the
 * application's Avro schema.  In this case, we use person.avsc to define the
 * content of a Person class.
 * <p>
 * An Ant build file was used to generate the specific class source file:
 * Person.java.  The generate-specific.xml file can be found in the avro
 * example directory, along with directions for use.
 * <p>
 * Because this example is using the {@link NoSQLAvroCacheStore} module to
 * interact with the Oracle NoSQL Database, it does not need to directly use
 * SpecificAvroBinding objects.  Instead, the application deals only with the
 * generated Person class.  SpecificAvroBinding objects are used under the
 * covers by the {@link NoSQLAvroCacheStore} and {@link NoSQLAvroSerializer}
 * classes to perform the object serialization on behalf of the user.
 * <p>
 * The cache-config.xml file in this directory includes a definition for the
 * AvroCache cache.  It is assumed that the reader has some level of familiarity
 * with Oracle Coherence cache configuration.  The AvroCache has a
 * cache-mapping that references a distributed-scheme named AvroCacheScheme.
 * Note that, although Oracle Coherence allows for a variety of different cache
 * schemes, {@link CacheStore} is specifically designed to work within
 * distributed cache schemes.
 * <p>
 * Please note that this example is structured, for simplicity, to assume that
 * the example program is the only member of the cache cluster.  In a real
 * environment it will be necessary to have all cache cluster members using the
 * same cache configuration file.
 * <p>
 * The distributed scheme contains a serializer definition that tells Oracle
 * Coherence to use the NoSQLAvroSerializer when serializing and de-serializing
 * objects in association with this cache.  Its configuration includes
 * init-param definitions for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code storeName} - identifies the Oracle NoSQL Database instance name
 *     which which the serializer is interacting.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code helperHosts} - contains a comma-separated list of host:port
 *     identifiers for hosts to contact in order to set up a connection to the
 *     Oracle NoSQL Database instance.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code schemaFiles} - contains a comma-separated list of schema file
 *     resources that may be needed.  This is needed for a cache application
 *     that may operate on Json or Generic format object representations.
 *     Because this example is using Specific representation, it is not
 *     actually needed, but is included here in order to allow conversion to an
 *     alternate format.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * The distributed-scheme also contains the definition of a cachestore-scheme
 * within a read-write-backing-map-scheme.  Here, the definition again specifies
 * storeName and helperHosts parameters to allow access to the KVStore instance,
 * but also defines an avroFormat parameter with the value {@code SPECIFIC}.
 * This setting tells the {@link NoSQLAvroCacheStore} module that when an
 * Avro-based object is loaded from the database, it should be rendered in
 * {@link SpecificRecord} format.  This means that the classpath must contain a
 * compiled class for each such Avro type that will be accessed by the cache
 * application.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the kvclient.jar file, this application also requires that
 * kvcoherence.jar and coherence.jar be included in the classpath.
 * kvcoherence.jar is included in the same directory as kvclient.jar for Oracle
 * NoSQL Database EE distributions.  The kvcoherence.jar file internally
 * references kvclient.jar so it does not need to be explicitly referenced in
 * the classpath.  The coherence.jar file should be downloaded and installed
 * separately.
 * <p>
 * To build this example in the examples/coherence directory:
 * <pre>
 *   cd KVHOME/examples/coherence
 *   mkdir classes
 *   javac -cp KVHOME/lib/kvcoherence.jar:COHERENCE_HOME/lib/coherence.jar \
 *       -d classes *.java
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The Person.java class in this directory was generated using the
 * generate-specific.xml ant build script found in the avro example directory.
 * It is useful to look at these files to understand how they are used, but
 * they should not be modified directly.
 * <p>
 * Before running this example program, start a KVStore instance.  The simplest
 * way to do that is to run kvlite as described in the Quickstart document.
 * <p>
 * After starting the KVStore instance, the Avro schema used by the example
 * must be added to the store using the administration command line interface
 * (CLI).  First start the admin CLI as described in the Oracle NoSQL Database
 * Administrator's Guide. Then enter the following command to add the example
 * schema:
 *  <pre>ddl add-schema -file person-schema.avsc</pre>
 *
 * After adding the schema, modify the coherence-cache.xml file, if necessary,
 * and update the defintions of the storeName and helperHosts parameters
 * with the appropriate values based on your kvstore instance.  For all
 * examples the default instance name is kvstore, the default host name is
 * localhost and the default port number is 5000.
 * Then, run this program, as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * java -cp classes:KVHOME/lib/kvcoherence.jar:COHERENCE_HOME/lib/coherence.jar:.. \
 *       -Dtangosol.pof.config=pof-config.xml \
 *       -Dtangosol.coherence.cacheconfig=cache-config.xml \
 *       coherence.AvroSpecificExample -cache AvroCache
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example a single key is used for storing a kv pair, where the value
 * is an object serialized as Avro binary data.  The first time the example is
 * run it inserts the kv pair, and subsequent times that it is run it reads and
 * updates the kv pair, incrementing the "age" field.
