/**
 * A simple KVStore client application that represents a {@code Value} as a
 * {@link GenericRecord} object using the Avro API, and serializes values using
 * a {@link GenericAvroBinding}.
 * <p>
 * When using an Avro binding, the Avro and Jackson jars must be in the
 * classpath, as well as the kvclient jar.  The Avro and Jackson jars are
 * included in the KVHOME/lib directory along with the kvclient jar:
 * <pre>
 *    kvclient.jar avro.jar jackson-core-asl.jar jackson-mapper-asl.jar
 * </pre>
 * As long as all four jars are in the same directory, only the kvclient jar
 * needs to be specified in the classpath, because the kvclient jar references
 * the other three jars.  If they are not in the same directory, all four
 * jars must be explicitly specified in the classpath.
 * <p>
 * To build this example in the examples/avro directory:
 * <pre>
 *   cd KVHOME/examples/avro
 *   mkdir classes
 *   javac -cp KVHOME/lib/kvclient.jar -d classes *.java
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Before running this example program, start a KVStore instance.  The simplest
 * way to do that is to run KV Lite as described in the Quickstart document.
 * <p>
 * After starting the KVStore instance, the Avro schema used by the example
 * must be added to the store using the administration command line interface
 * (CLI).  First start the admin CLI as described in the Oracle NoSQL Database
 * Administrator's Guide. Then enter the following command to add the example
 * schema:
 *  <pre>ddl add-schema -file member-schemas.avsc</pre>
 *
 * After adding the schema, use the KVStore instance name, host and port for
 * running this program, as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * java -cp classes:KVHOME/lib/kvclient.jar avro.GenericExample \
 *                       -store &lt;instance name&gt; \
 *                       -host  &lt;host name&gt;     \
 *                       -port  &lt;port number&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * For all examples the default instance name is kvstore, the default host name
 * is localhost and the default port number is 5000.  These defaults match the
 * defaults for running kvlite, so the simplest way to run the examples along
 * with kvlite is to omit all parameters.
 * <p>
 * In this example a single key is used for storing a kv pair, where the value
 * is an object serialized as Avro binary data.  The first time the example is
 * run it inserts the kv pair, and subsequent times that it is run it reads and
 * updates the kv pair, incrementing the "age" field.
 * <p>
 * This example may also be used to demonstrate simple schema evolution by
 * performing the following steps:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *   Build and run the example as described above.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *   Change the FullName schema in member-schemas.avsc to add the "middle"
 *   field, including a default value:
 *   <pre>
 *      "fields": [
 *          {"name": "first", "type": "string", "default": ""},
 *          {"name": "middle", "type": "string", "default": ""},
 *          {"name": "last", "type": "string", "default": ""}
 *      ]
 *   </pre>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *   Uncomment the two lines in the example that set the middle name field.  In
 *   other words, change:
 *   <pre>
 *          //final GenericRecord name = (GenericRecord) member.get("name");
 *          //name.put("middle", "Lawrence");
 *   </pre>
 *   to:
 *   <pre>
 *          final GenericRecord name = (GenericRecord) member.get("name");
 *          name.put("middle", "Lawrence");
 *   </pre>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *   Build and run the modified example as before.  The -evolve option must be
 *   used with the add-schema command as follows:
 *   <pre>ddl add-schema -file member-schemas.avsc -evolve</pre>
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * When the example is run after being changed, the initial value that is read
 * (which was stored with the old version of the schema) will be displayed with
 * a middle name field with an empty string value.  This is because, when Avro
 * deserializes a stored value that has no middle name field, it adds the
 * middle name field because it is present in the reader schema, and it assigns
 * it the default value for that field.  A default value is required whenever a
 * new field is added.
 * <p>
 * The updated example will also set the middle name to "Lawrence" when it
 * increments the age field and stores the updated value.  So the final value
 * displayed will include this updated value for the middle name.
 * <p>
 * You can also reverse this process to demonstrate what happens when a client
 * using the old schema reads and writes a kv pair that was written earlier
 * using the new schema.  To try this, undo the two changes above -- remove the
 * middle name field from the schema and comment out the two lines that set the
 * middle name value -- and then build and run the program.
 * <p>
 * When the example is run after undoing these changes, the initial value that
 * is read (which was stored with the new version of the schema) will be
 * displayed without a middle name field.  This is because, when Avro
 * deserializes a stored value that has a middle name, it ignores it because no
 * middle name field is present in the reader schema.
 * <p>
 * Note that when this version of the example program updates the age field and
 * writes the modified record, no middle name is included in the stored data.
 * In other words, the middle name that was stored earlier is lost.
 * <p>
 * Also note that the same rules apply when a field is intentionally deleted
 * in a new version of the schema because it is no longer needed.  From the
 * Avro perspective, there is no difference between the two scenarios.
